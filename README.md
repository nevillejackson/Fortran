# Fortran #
This repository contains various Fortran programs and subroutine libraries useful in statistical analysis and quantitative genetics. Some are my own software and some are collected from the public domain. All are free of copyright or other usage restrictions. Most of this software is documented in the traditional manner with comment lines at the beginning of each program. Some programs (eg nesreg, mcano, pivot) have pdf files.

## ab ##
The subdirectory _ab_ contains programs used in animal breeding calculations
The subdirectory _abtest_ contains test data for the routines in subdirectory _ab_.

## Data manipulation ##
The subdirectory _Charm_ contains Fortran5 programs for data manipulation using unit record principles, written by Anne Swinton. Charm is documented by man pages to be found in the _doc_ subdirectory. The subdirectory _charmcodedftn4_ contains older Fortran4 programs for the same purpose, written by Neville Jackson and Rod Evans..

## DFREML ##
The derivative-free REML program written by Karen Meyer. Estimates variance components and quantitative genetic parameters for mixed models.

## Harvey least squares program ##
The subdirectory _Harvey_ contain a number of modern versions of Walter Harvey's least squares and maximum likelihood program. The subdirectory _Harvey.old_ contains several older versions.

## mcano ##
The subdirectory _mcano_ contains a program for canonical correlation analysis using IBM SSP subroutines

## Nested regression ##
The subdirectories _nesregx_ contain contain the program versions nesreg2 and nesreg3. The subdirectory _nesregtest_ contains test data for nesreg. The subdirectory _nesregdoc_ contains documentation for all versions of nesreg.

## Pamfun ##
The subdirectory _Pamfun_ contains a program for calculating  genetic and phenotypic parameters of a trait which is a linear or multiplicative function of several traits the parameters of which are known

## pivot ##
The subdirectory _pivot_ contains the pivot.f subroutine published by Garside(1971) as algorithm AS 37

## Restricted selection indices  ##
The subdirectories _resix_ contain programs for calculation of selection indices with restrictions

## sr6600 ##
The subdirectory _sr6600_ contains  a very old collection of fortran routines used on CSIRO Control Data mainframes in the 1970's

## ssp ##
The subdirectory _ssp_ contains  the original IBM scientific subroutine package.

## Statistics ##
The subdirectory _stats_ contains a collection of personal routines for statistical calculations. 

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
Fortran code written for scientific purposes needs to be preserved in an accessible form.
