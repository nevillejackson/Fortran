This directory carries out the same analysis as Example3.

The only difference is the use of an "equivalent model" to model
covariances due to permanent environmental effects of the animal -
instead of fitting corresponding sets of random regression
coeffficients, these covariances are taken into account as covariances
between residuals.  This results in less equations in the MMM,
although there is no saving in computational requirements per
likelihood evaluation.
